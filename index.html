  <!-- ENGINEERING MINDSET -->
  <section id="mindset">
    <h3>Engineering Mindset</h3>
    <p>
      I approach game development as a software engineering problem — focusing on scalability,
      maintainability, and performance rather than quick hacks. I aim to build systems that are
      easy to extend, debug, and confidently ship to production.
