<!-- ================= INTRO ================= -->
<section>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Nikhil Chaudhary</strong>, a
        <strong>Multiplayer Unity Game Developer</strong>
        with 2+ years of professional experience building games for
        <strong>Android, iOS, WebGL, and Windows</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I don’t just focus on making games work —
        I focus on designing <strong>systems that scale</strong>,
        remain maintainable, and perform reliably
        under real-world multiplayer conditions.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PHASE 1 ================= -->
<section>
    <h3>Phase 1 — Foundations & Systems Thinking</h3>

    <p>
        My journey began with learning <strong>C# and Unity</strong>,
        building small gameplay prototypes, UI systems,
        and single-player mechanics.
    </p>

    <p>
        Very early on, I realized that code quality matters more than
        quick results. This led me to focus on
        <strong>clean architecture, modular design, and reusability</strong>
        instead of tightly coupled logic.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Gameplay mechanics & player controllers</li>
        <li>UI systems and menu flows</li>
        <li>ScriptableObjects for data-driven design</li>
        <li>State Machines & Strategy patterns</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= PHASE 2 ================= -->
<section>
    <h3>Phase 2 — Multiplayer & Architecture</h3>

    <p>
        To push beyond single-player limitations,
        I transitioned into <strong>multiplayer game development</strong>.
        This introduced real engineering challenges —
        synchronization, latency, authority, and consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
        I worked extensively with <strong>Photon (PUN)</strong> and
        <strong>Socket.IO</strong>, designing room-based systems,
        matchmaking flows, and player-ready synchronization.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Room creation & matchmaking systems</li>
        <li>Player-ready & scene synchronization</li>
        <li>Authoritative vs client-driven logic</li>
        <li>Network data optimization</li>
        <li>Reconnect-safe multiplayer flows</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= PHASE 3 ================= -->
<section>
    <h3>Phase 3 — Production Engineering & Scale</h3>

    <p>
        My focus evolved further when working on
        <strong>live production games with millions of users</strong>.
        At this stage, stability and performance
        mattered more than features.
    </p>

    <p>
        I contributed to production-ready systems by improving
        gameplay stability, optimizing UI for multiple devices,
        and ensuring systems could be maintained by teams.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Performance optimization (mobile & WebGL)</li>
        <li>Memory management & object pooling</li>
        <li>Backend integration (Firebase, Node.js, MongoDB)</li>
        <li>Data persistence & player progression</li>
        <li>Production debugging & live issue resolution</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY ================= -->
<section>
    <h3>My Engineering Mindset</h3>

    <p>
        I approach game development as an
        <strong>engineering discipline</strong>, not just creative coding.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Design systems that other developers can understand</li>
        <li>Write code that survives feature growth</li>
        <li>Prioritize performance and stability early</li>
        <li>Build multiplayer systems that fail gracefully</li>
        <li>Document and structure code for team scalability</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= GOAL ================= -->
<section>
    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>

    <p>
        My goal is to grow into a
        <strong>high-impact game engineer</strong>
        who builds systems that scale,
        mentors other developers,
        and contributes to long-term product success.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe in <strong>deep learning, clean systems,
        and practical engineering</strong> over shortcuts.
